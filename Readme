Compile using the command: gcc -o filename filename.c -lm

euler_1b.c runs without arguments.
euler_1d.c runs without arguments.

Both programs output a .txt file with the data for the plots of the chosen method.

.txt name structure: plot_data_<type>_<method>_<type of loop and axis>

nl: non-linear.
e: Euler's method.
i: Improved Euler's Method.
cl: closed-loop.
o<axis>: open-loop for <axis> axis.

.txt file structure:
col1 = time.
col2 = x(t).
col3 = x'(t).
col4 = y(t).
col5 = y'(t).
col6 = c(t).
col7 = c'(t).

Run Plotting.m in Matlab to draw the plots of the files that are created throu the programs.
